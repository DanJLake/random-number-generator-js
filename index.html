      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <p>
        To generate a random number between 0 and 100 just click ‘Generate’.
        There are also options that allow you to generate a number between any two numbers, and a decimal number with any number of decimal places.
      </p>
      <h2>About random number generation</h2>
      <p>
        Generating random numbers has always been a challenge for developers, in the past various methods of generation have been used however these all have a degree of non-randomness to them, 
        whether that be using a seed value based on the time and date, linear recurrence in binary or several other methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method deemed the most random is currently measuring atmospheric noise and calculating a value based on this, however even this is changed by real world variables, 
        meaning it is not truly random, the recurring theme for developers trying to generate completely random numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        New methods are currently being researched to improve the unpredictability of these generators, Intel are currently researching a method of random number generation based on 
        fluctuations in voltage and temperature inside a chip, this would likely be just as random as the atmospheric noise measurements due to the fact each chip’s reading at any 
        given moment would be unique, there is no way to know a chips exact voltage and temperature at any given millisecond and two identical chips would likely produce different 
        readings even if they were given the same command at the exact same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site generates random numbers by taking a number generated based on a time/date seed and changing the number based on other random factors to increase the randomness of the number.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is true randomness so important?</h2>
      <p>
        To most people, there would be no difference between a pseudo random number (A seemingly random number, however it could be reproduced in the original conditions) and a true random number, 
        they are both calculated based on events or factors that repeat irregularly and immeasurably. For some though, it is important a ‘random’ number cannot be predicted ahead of time, 
        this could be for a lottery, cryptography, a game or any reason that feels important to the person. Knowledge of the way a pseudo random number is generated will allow a malicious actor 
        to either manipulate the number or successfully calculate/predict it. This would obviously be a problem for both cryptography and a lottery, imagine a jackpot being won due to the 
        winning numbers being calculated beforehand with an algorithm, or a hacker being able to decrypt a website’s passwords due to knowing how to calculate the encryption key!
      </p>
      <h2>Should I really use randomly generated PINs/Passcodes?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. People are predictable. Many might use a memorable date, others an easily memorized sequence, a code they use everywhere or even the dreaded ‘0000’ or ‘1234’. 
        The problem is these are easily guessed by anyone who makes a conscious effort to try and crack the code. When it comes to security, dropping those predictable patterns is 
        the only way to fully secure your account or device.
